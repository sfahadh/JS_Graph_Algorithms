# JS_Graph_Algorithms
A series of graph related problems to help those new to the graph data structure. Each problem includes a description of the problem, test cases to check whether or not the correct solution was given, and solutions to the problem if all hope seems lost when trying to solve the problem. 

## Graph Topics	
    - Directed Graph
    - Undirected Graph
    - Weighted Graph
    - Unweighted Graph
    - Cyclic Graph
    - Acyclic Graph
    - More will be included soon...

## Algorithm Topics
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Recursion

## How to get started
