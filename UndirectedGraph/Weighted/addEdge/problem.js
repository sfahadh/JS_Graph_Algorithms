TODO: Complete the following add edge problem below. There are four inputs, the adjacency list of the graph, the 2 vertices to establish the relationship, and the weight of the relationship between the 2 vertices. The goal of this problem is to add an edge with weight between the two vertices then return the adjacency list.

function UnweightedGraph() {
    this.adjacencyList = {};
}

! Test Case:
* Sample Input: { "A": [], "B": [], "C": [] }, "B", "C", 10
* Sample Output: { 
    "A": [], 
    "B": [{ vertix: "C", weight: 10 }], 
    "C": [{ vertix: "B", weight: 10 }]
